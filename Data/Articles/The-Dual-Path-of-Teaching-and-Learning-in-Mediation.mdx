The process of teaching others can often become a valuable opportunity for personal learning and growth, particularly for those who hold a fervent desire to continuously refine their existing knowledge. Recently, my respected colleague Professor Mary Bryant Frank conducted a session on the significance of psychology in mediation, presenting many salient points that struck a chord with me.

As mediators, we frequently debate whether the *'Caucus'—a* private meeting in dispute resolution—effectively unravels all the complex issues, thus paving the way for disputing parties to return to the negotiation table poised to strike a settlement. Certainly, the Caucus sets the stage for necessary compromises, potentially cutting through to the heart of the issue.

Yet, it may come as a surprise to some that this Caucus method does not thoroughly address all the underlying issues in a dispute. In practice, selections are often made based on what is most expedient, leaving other concerns by the wayside—a process referred to as 'cutting to the chase'—before parties continue forward.

As a mediator, I value the importance of taking notes, particularly for capturing the important points that I identify through active listening. However, I also believe that focusing solely on consistently recording these notes, without integrating this practice with a genuine connection to the parties involved in the dispute, can lead to a lack of connection.

Every time I have the platform to speak on the subject of mediation and what it means to be a mediator, I emphasize its distinct nature. Being a mediator often requires a level of dedication and empathy that goes beyond ordinary interactions—it's about fully committing your essence to the role.

If a mediator merely goes through the motions without deep commitment, the profession simply becomes a transactional job motivated by fees. While it's clear that mediation is not altruistic by default, it does call for significant dedication from those who choose to walk this professional path.

Currently, the need for mediation is tremendous. It is an opportune moment for those passionate about mediation to engage with the field, as demand for effective mediation is high.
